## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript (for demo button interactivity)
- Accessibility best practices (e.g. `aria-label`s for social links)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce:

- The power of semantic HTML and reusable utility classes (`.text-sm`, `.body-big`, etc.)
- Using `<span>` instead of `<br>` for more control over multiline text styling
- Layering elements with `z-index` to create visual depth
- Structuring a responsive grid layout using `minmax()` and `auto-fit`

### Continued development

Next, I’d like to:

- Convert this project into a React component-based structure.
- Implement form validation in the “Get Access” section.
- Explore animating testimonials using JavaScript or CSS transitions.
